Automated Resume Screening - Develop a tool that filters resumes based on job descriptions using NLP.

Step-by-Step Approach
1️⃣ Data Extraction
  Extract text from PDF & DOCX resumes.
  Extract job descriptions from a given input.
  📌 Libraries Used: pymupdf, python-docx

2️⃣ Text Preprocessing
  Remove stopwords, punctuation, special characters.
  Apply lemmatization to convert words into their root forms.
  📌 Libraries Used: nltk, re, string

3️⃣ Resume Matching Using NLP
  Convert resumes & job descriptions into numerical vectors.
  Use TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency).
  Compute similarity scores using Cosine Similarity.
  📌 Libraries Used: sklearn.feature_extraction.text, sklearn.metrics.pairwise

4️⃣ Ranking & Shortlisting Candidates
  Sort resumes based on similarity score.
  Only retain candidates with a score above a threshold (e.g., 70%).
  📌 Libraries Used: numpy, pandas

5️⃣ ATS Integration
  Export results in CSV format for integration into an ATS (Applicant Tracking System).
  📌 Libraries Used: pandas

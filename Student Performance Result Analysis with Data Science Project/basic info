Student performance analysis using data science involves systematically collecting, 
processing, and analyzing educational data to gain insights into factors influencing academic outcomes.
By employing techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and 
predictive modeling, educators and researchers can identify patterns and correlations that
inform interventions and improvements. For instance, analyzing correlations between 
parental education levels and student scores can highlight areas where targeted support may be beneficial. 
Additionally, predictive models can forecast student performance, enabling early identification
of at-risk students and timely interventions. This data-driven approach not only enhances understanding of 
academic performance but also supports the development of personalized learning strategies and policies aimed at improving educational outcomes.
